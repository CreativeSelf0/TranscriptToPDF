## The need to raise money before starting a startup 

 [**Reference**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBUhQPPS9AY&t=411) 

 [okay the next myth I want to talk about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBUhQPPS9AY&t=411) [is this idea that I need to raise money](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBUhQPPS9AY&t=412) [before I can

of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBUhQPPS9AY&t=436) [it and then they go get some users for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBUhQPPS9AY&t=440) [it and then only then when they see that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBUhQPPS9AY&t=442) [people are starting to use it and maybe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBUhQPPS9AY&t=444) [there's some value being created do they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBUhQPPS9AY&t=446) [start thinking about raising money and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBUhQPPS9AY&t=448) [the reason for this is that it's cheaper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBUhQPPS9AY&t=450) [than ever to build a prototype of a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBUhQPPS9AY&t=451) [product to build a first version
