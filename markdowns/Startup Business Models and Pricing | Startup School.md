there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=194) [some interesting things that we see here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=197) [first is that that SAS businesses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=198) [actually make up 31 of the top 100 YC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=201) [companies transactional businesses

well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=249) [turns out that 50 of the overall value](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=251) [of the top 100 YC companies actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=254) [comes from just the top ten and so it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=257) [interesting to look at what insights we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=260) [can get from these 10 companies too and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=262) [here they are these are the top 10 YC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=264) [companies by value there's Airbnb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=267) [there's stripe there's instacart there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=270) [coinbase there's doordash there's Reddit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=273) [there's a number of companies here that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=276) [you're probably very familiar with or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=279) [use on a regular basis and what's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=280) [especially interesting is that five of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=283) [the YC top 10 are actually marketplaces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=285) [there's Airbnb there's instacart there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=288) [doordash there's openc and there's Fair](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=292) [the interesting takeaway here is that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=295) [marketplaces are most likely to build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=297) [winner take all companies they tend to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=299) [become so big and dominant in their](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=301) [industry that it doesn't leave much room](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=304) [or market share for other competitors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=307) [once marketplaces actually get huge so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=309) [marketplaces are 14 of the top 100](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=312) [companies but they actually create 30 of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=314) [the overall value because so many are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=318) [represented here in the top ten and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=320) [while marketplaces are really tough to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=322) [get off the ground they have a chicken](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=324) [and egg problem where you can't just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=325) [build your product and then sell it to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=328) [customers you actually need to solve for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=330) [both sides of the marketplace the supply](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=332) [and the demand at the same time in order](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=335) [to get customers however once they hit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=337) [the inflection point and they start to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=340) [work they get massive Network effects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=343) [where each new user of the platform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=345) [increases the value for everybody else](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=348) [that's what makes them dominant winners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=350) [so you can think of companies like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=352) [Airbnb if you are looking to rent out a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=354) [place short term to stay then chances](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=357) [are you would go to Airbnb because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=360) [that's where all the inventory is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=362) [similarly if you wanted to buy or sell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=363) [nfts you would probably go to openc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=366) [because that's where everyone is that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=369) [how these become the big Winners it also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=371) [turns out that three of the YC top 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=374) [are transactional businesses too so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=376) [these are companies like stripe coinbase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=379) [and brex and the main takeaway here is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=381) [that transactional business is far](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=384) [outperform because they're directly in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=387) [the flow of funds this means that they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=389) [are the platform that money flows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=391) [through making it very easy for them to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=394) [just take their cut and so transactional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=396) [companies are 22 of the top 100 YC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=399) [companies but they actually create 29 of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=403) [the overall value and this is because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=406) [there is close to the transaction as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=408) [possible this was advice that I received](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=410) [during my YC batch back in 2010](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=413) [and that was to get as close to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=416) [transaction as possible if you're a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=418) [company like stripe that literally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=421) [processes money for companies or brex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=423) [that is the corporate card that they use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=426) [to spend money then you're directly in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=428) [that flow of funds and so it's really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=430) [easy to take your cut on the opposite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=433) [extreme if you are an affiliate business](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=436) [multiple things have to happen before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=438) [you ultimately get paid which means that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=440) [you are very far from the transaction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=443) [which makes those not as good of a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=444) [business for transactional businesses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=446) [because they're so close to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=449) [transaction they often become critical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=450) [infrastructure for other companies that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=452) [they build on top of and that usually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=455) [means that they are solving a top three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=457) [problem for them so you can imagine if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=459) [you use stripe as your primary method to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=462) [get paid from your customers the thought](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=464) [of ripping that out sounds terrible you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=467) [would never want to do that and that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=470) [why these transactional businesses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=472) [become so dominant we also see that SAS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=473) [businesses are most likely to make the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=476) [top 100 list and this is because they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=478) [have consistent Revenue so 31 of the YC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=480) [top 100 companies are actually SAS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=485) [businesses that's nearly a third and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=488) [this is because the recurring Revenue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=490) [makes them great businesses this means](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=492) [that customers keep paying them every](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=495) [single month or every single year until](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=497) [the customer explicitly says to stop so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=500) [this has lots of benefits including the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=503) [predictable Revenue that they get which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=505) [allows them to compound and grow their](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=508) [business we can also see that very few](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=510) [advertising businesses become big](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=512) [Winners and this may be surprising](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=514) [because we're so familiar with so many](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=516) [companies that have built their business](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=519) [off of an advertising business model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=521) [there's Google there's Facebook there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=523) [Twitter just to name a few but really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=526) [only three percent of the top 100 YC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=528) [companies use an advertising business](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=531) [model as their primary way to make money](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=534) [and that's because advertising](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=535) [businesses need organic virality to win](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=538) [they need to catch lightning in a

Revenue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=605) [scaling with people rather than software](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=606) [and having very low margins as a result](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=609) [so that's why these businesses are not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=612) [Venture scale similarly

you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=619) [have to acquire a customer so send them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=622) [off to another product or service hope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=624) [that they actually make a transaction on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=627) [that other product or you will get some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=629) [small commission from that 30 to 90 days](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=631) [later so it's too hard to make a lot

and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=644) [they have low margins as a result so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=646) [that makes it really difficult to start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=649) [these businesses and also to scale them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=650) [even if they're working just requires

don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=657) [see in this list either that's because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=660) [they tend to have a lot of platform

consistently](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=684) [creates winners and this is because it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=686) [is highly predictable once a customer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=689) [has committed to pay they're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=692) [continue paying until they explicitly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=694) [say that they want to stop paying they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=696) [also have higher customer lifetime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=698) [values versus one-off transactions and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=700) [this results in lower customer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=703) [acquisition costs so you don't have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=705) [keep reacquiring customers over and over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=707) [if you have a one-off transactional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=709) [business then you have to invest money](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=712) [in acquiring that customer the first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=714) [time and then also keep putting more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=716) [money into trying to get existing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=719) [customers to spend more with you that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=721) [not the case with recurring Revenue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=724) [businesses but recurring Revenue only](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=726) [works when you have strong retention](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=729) [it's not enough for your product to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=731) [deliver value right up front and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=733) [never again you need to keep delivering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=736) [value over and over again otherwise your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=738) [customers will churn and stop paying and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=741) [then you can't scale a leaky bucket if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=744) [you have lots of churn and to give you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=746) [an example of that if you had 95 monthly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=747) [retention for your recurring Revenue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=750) [product so that means that five percent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=752) [of your customers will churn and stop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=755) [paying you every single month and if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=758) [started with 100 customers at the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=760) [beginning of the year then by the end of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=762) [the year you would only have 54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=765) [customers of your original 100. that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=767) [means that you would lose 46 of

to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=775) [break even with where you started the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=778) [year and let's say for example you had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=780) [90 monthly retention instead of 95 just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=782) [a five percent difference there and that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=786) [would actually lead to only 28 customers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=788) [at the end of that first year that's a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=791) [huge difference and a huge hill to climb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=794) [so just that five percent difference in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=797) [monthly retention can actually be the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=799) [difference between life and death for

your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1065) [product yet or you're talking to the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1067) [wrong customer segment stripe is a great](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1069) [example of this in the early days](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1071) [stripe wanted to test the amount of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1074) [value that they were building in their](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1076) [product so while most of their](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1078) [competitors were actually charging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1080) [around three percent per transaction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1081) [stripe decided to set their price at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1084) [five percent per transaction nearly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1087) [double what their competitors were](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1089) [charging and the reason that they did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1090) [this is because they wanted to test how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1092) [much value their customers saw in things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1094) [like one-click sign up and being able to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1097) [get started quickly and really in-depth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1100) [detailed developer API documentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1103) [that would help developers get started](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1105) [faster and so rather than trying to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1108) [undercut the competition in order to win](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1110) [customers they did the exact opposite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1113) [and set a really high bar for themselves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1115) [to prove that they had built enough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1118) [value into their product so where should](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1120) [you begin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1123) [the first thing that I recommend is that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1124) [you don't overthink it if you look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1126) [online there are tons of charts and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1128) [graphs and formulas and all these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1130) [different complicated ways to maximize](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1132) [your pricing and figure out the right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1135) [price to charge but really when you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1136) [just getting started the important thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1138) [is to just find the right order of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1140) [magnitude for your pricing and what I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1142) [mean by that is if you're charging ten](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1144) [dollars for your product and your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1147) [customers are willing to pay a hundred](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1148) [you should probably change your price](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1150) [you're off by an order of magnitude](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1152) [however if you're charging ten dollars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1153) [and your customers are willing to pay 15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1156) [or 20 don't worry about it you're in the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1158) [right ballpark which is the really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1161) [important thing and pricing isn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1163) [permanent this is really important it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1166) [often takes years to iterate and capture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1168) [the full value of the product that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1170) [you've built from your customers and so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1172) [don't worry about capturing that full](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1175) [value early on you'll have plenty of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1176) [time to maximize that the next Insight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1179) [is that you should price on value not on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1181) [cost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1184) [and so there's three important](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1185) [components here the first is the cost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1186) [this is what it costs you to be able to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1189) [serve your customer the next variable is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1192) [price this is what you're charging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1194) [and then there's the perceived value](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1196) [that your customers see in your product](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1198) [and so Founders often start with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1201) [something called Cost Plus pricing I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1204) [would not recommend this what this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1206) [usually looks like is looking at how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1208) [much it costs you to serve a customer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1210) [and then adding an amount on top of that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1211) [say ten dollars and that's your price](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1214) [but this actually ignores the full value](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1216) [of what your customers see in your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1219) [product so the difference between your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1222) [cost to serve your customer and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1225) [price that you charge that's your margin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1227) [that's how much you make on each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1229) [transaction and the difference between](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1231) [the price](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1233) [and the value](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1235) [that your customers see in your product](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1236) [that's your opportunity to be able to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1239) [raise your prices to be able to capture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1242) [more of that perceived value and now if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1244) [your cost is higher than your price](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1246) [well that means that you're going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1249) [have negative margins and you cannot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1251) [scale a business with negative margins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1253) [similarly if your price is higher than](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1255) [the value that your customers see in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1258) [your product that means they're just not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1260) [going to buy from you so how do you find](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1262) [your value well there's a couple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1264) [interesting ways to be able to do this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1266) [the first is talk to your users you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1267) [ask them about the problem that you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1271) [solve and get them to articulate the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1273) [value to you and so what this often](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1275) [looks like is if you reach out to a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1278) [customer and you get them on a call and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1280) [you can ask them what is the problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1282) [that you are hoping that our product](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1284) [could solve for you and they'll often](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1287) [tell you and similarly if you have a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1289) [user that's signed up for your product](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1291) [but is not actually paying you you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1293) [reach out to them and talk to them and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1295) [ask them the question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1297) [what problem were you hoping that our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1299) [product could solve for you and their](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1301) [response is usually going to be one of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1303) [four interesting things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1305) [the first is they're probably going to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1307) [tell you that they were hoping you could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1309) [help them make more money this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1311) [something every company wants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1313) [or they might tell you that they were](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1315) [hoping that you could help reduce costs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1316) [maybe your product saves them time or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1319) [money they might also say that they were](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1322) [hoping that your product could help them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1325) [move faster maybe they have something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1326) [they were looking to launch in six](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1329) [months and with your product they can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1330) [actually get it launched in a couple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1332) [weeks that sounds really valuable or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1334) [they might say that your product could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1336) [help them avoid risk if you help with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1338) [compliance or offloading something a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1340) [headache that they don't want to deal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1342) [with another way to find your value is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1343) [to keep incrementally raising prices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1346) [until you get pushback from users and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1348) [when you keep incrementally raising your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1351) [prices you will ultimately find the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1353) [ideal price which is when customers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1356) [complain but they still pay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1358) [this is actually a good thing right it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1361) [overcomes that fear of charging a high](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1363) [price and customers walking away because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1366) [the ideal scenario is when you tell the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1369) [customer a price they say they have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1372) [think about it they go back and then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1374) [they come back to you a week later and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1377) [they say all right that seems good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1378) [you're the best solution we're willing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1380) [to pay up on the other side if you were](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1382) [to actually charge a lower price and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1384) [they say yeah that sounds great and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1386) [accept immediately well that probably](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1387) [means that you're pricing too low and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1389) [you're leaving a lot of money on the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1391) [table which brings me to my third](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1393) [Insight which is that most startups are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1394) [actually under charging you almost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1397) [certainly are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1399) [and lower prices are not a sustainable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1400) [Advantage sometimes we talk to Founders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1403) [and they say well our product is just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1405) [like our large competitor except ours is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1408) [cheaper and that actually does not sound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1410) [like a good idea that's not a way to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1412) [build a winner all that means is that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1415) [your large competitor can underprice you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1417) [even way lower than your cost because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1420) [they have way more money and they're way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1422) [larger than you until they put you out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1424) [of business so I do not recommend having](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1427) [price as your only differentiator it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1430) [also turns out that when you charge more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1432) [you get higher margins and you're able](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1434) [to build a bigger moat this means if you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1437) [have higher margins than your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1439) [competitors you can pay more to acquire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1440) [a customer which means you can acquire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1443) [all of the customers before they do it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1445) [also important to remember that pricing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1448) [implies value when customers are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1449) [evaluating your product they typically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1452) [don't have a lot of signals on how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1454) [valuable your product is but the price](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1456) [that you're charging is actually one of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1458) [the primary ones so if your price is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1460) [lower than your competitors then your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1462) [customers might assume that your product](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1465) [is less valuable than theirs similarly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1467) [if you charge a higher price then your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1470) [customers might assume that your product](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1473) [is even more valuable than your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1474) [competitors so that can work really well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1476) [and so it turns out that raising prices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1478) [is actually the easiest way to grow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1480) [Revenue if you have a thousand customers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1482) [and you want to double your Revenue well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1485) [it sounds pretty difficult to spend all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1488) [the time energy and money to go get a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1490) [thousand more customers however if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1492) [you're able to just double your price](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1495) [just changing a number on the website or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1497) [changing the price that you're quoting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1499) [to customers in a sales call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1501) [and your product supports that higher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1503) [value well you've just doubled your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1506) [Revenue with almost no work at all but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1508) [what if users won't pay more this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1511) [usually means one of two things it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1513) [either means that you need to build more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1515) [value into your product right maybe the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1518) [price that you have raised it to is now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1520) [higher than the value that your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1523) [customers see or it could mean that you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1526) [need to solve a bigger problem maybe the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZbWzAyHAE&t=1528) [problem that you're solving
