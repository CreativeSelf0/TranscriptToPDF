 [**Reference**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=41) 

 [clarify something what do we mean by the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=42) [word co-founder yeah so quite literally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=44) [a co-founder is someone who starts your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=47) [startup with you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=50) [um so when you apply to YC we consider](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=51) [someone to be your co-founder if they](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=53) [have at least 10 Equity but in general a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=54) [co-founder is someone who is there from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=57) [the beginning or close to the

and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=66) [I don't doubt you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=68) [um the short answer is yes you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=69) [absolutely can but it's it's really hard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=70) [like really really hard you know a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=73) [startup is a very difficult Journey for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=75) [anyone and doing it alone makes it more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=77) [than twice as hard and so you know we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=80) [really recommend having a co-founder

literally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=91) [move two or three times as fast you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=93) [just get so much more stuff done](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=95) [additionally your brainstorming can be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=97) [higher quality right you can help each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=100) [other see around corners and bounce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=101) [ideas off each other exactly kind of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=103) [maybe not get into a rut with a bad idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=105) [and have someone checking um](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=107) [accountability is you know a little bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=108) [more effective when there's someone else](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=111) [there you know you do your daily stand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=112) [up and say this is what I'm going to

list](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=174) [obviously goes on and on but we also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=176) [have some quantitative data to share so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=178) [while YC does fund solo Founders yes we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=180) [do we do fun solo founders of YC's

a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=191) [clear pattern among the solar Founders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=194) [as well they are always able to make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=196) [progress on their own so they built](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=198) [their own MEP they got their own

topics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1061) [that we should have discussed early on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1063) [that just became bigger problems

we'd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1080) [really discuss so about six months into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1081) [our startup Journey he was getting

topic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1096) [that we should have discussed earlier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1099) [was about finances and how long we could](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1100) [each afford to go with little to no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1103) [salary so there was a little bit of a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1105) [mismatch with the founders on this of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1106) [course everyone's financial situation is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1107) [different this put a little bit of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1109) [unexpected pressure on the company at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1110) [some at one point it kind of came out of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1112) [nowhere it felt like it came out

any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1122) [of these deals I think if we'd known](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1123) [sooner we probably could have made some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1125) [decisions earlier on to avoid these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1127) [distractions and so just these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1129) [conversations would have been really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1131) [helpful to have had up front gotcha

at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1444) [um there might need to be some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1446) [structural roles and responsibilities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1447) [that are defined to keep decision making](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1449) [really fast so on my first company we](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1451) [made the mistake of trying to keep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1453) [everything equal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1455) [um and there are many of you there are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1457) [four of us yeah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1459) [um so you know we talked earlier about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1460) [how splitting Equity equally is a good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1461) [idea and like totally agree with that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1464) [the equity was not the problem the first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1465) [kind of yellow flag that came up was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1468) [that we decided to not have any titles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1469) [like we all called ourselves co-founder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1471) [um and so in and of itself that wasn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1474) [really a problem but there's kind of two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1476) [issues with this one is as it correlated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1478) [that we tried to make all of our](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1481) [decisions by consensus consensus meaning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1482) [you all had to agree on the decision to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1484) [move forward yeah for like any decision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1487) [um so I don't think I need to go into it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1489) [with this group on my why that's a bad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1491) [idea but at the time it felt really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1492) [equal and it felt Equitable but also the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1493) [the fact that we had no type no titles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1496) [was a little bit of a yellow flag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1498) [because it was an early indicator that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1499) [the team couldn't have hard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1501) [conversations and we couldn't make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1503) [decisions when there was disagreement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1505) [right and so it was like the consensus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1507) [and the lack of titles were like both](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1509) [kind of symptoms of the same thing you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1511) [know having to make decisions by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1513) [consensus was ultimately disastrous like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1514) [we would just spin we would get stuck in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1516) [gridlock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1517) [um so let's talk about some ways to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1519) [protect against this so you all don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1520) [repeat my mistake yeah so as Divya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1522) [mentioned having clear titles or at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1524) [least naming one person the CEO can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1526) [certainly help none of this co-ceo stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1528) [it helps break ties and disagreement and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1531) [it's also just really good practice for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1533) [having hard conversations where two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1534) [people may not agree not being able to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1536) [pick a CEO could be a sign that you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1538) [not able to make hard decisions together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1541) [in addition to titles it's important to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1542) [establish a few other things that can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1545) [help with decision making so clear areas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1546) [of ownership within the company who is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1548) [the final decision maker for different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1550) [types of decisions this could be a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1552) [different person in different functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1554) [but it's important to know who it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1555) [what happens if the other person degrees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1557) [disagrees slightly versus strongly maybe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1559) [the way you deal with it is different in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1562) [those cases and finally it can be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1564) [helpful to set up a structure for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1566) [accountability so once you've made your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1567) [decision at some point you should check](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1569) [back in to see how that decision played](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1570) [out and whether anything needs to change](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1573) [in the process moving forward clear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1574) [areas of ownership are very

that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1580) [work it's also very important to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4SLDQDXdp0&t=1582) [understand each other's personality
