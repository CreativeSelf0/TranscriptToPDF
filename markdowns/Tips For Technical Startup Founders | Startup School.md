and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=146) [sometimes I get the question of who is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=149) [the CEO or CTO for a technical founder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=152) [and this is a nuanced answer it really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=154) [depends on the type of product

like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=172) [in the early eight stages it looks a lot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=174) [like being a lead developer like if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=177) [you've been a lead developer a company](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=180) [you were in charge of putting

with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=222) [users to really get those insights to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=223) [iterate and you're going to have a

all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=253) [of these is to say is the technical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=257) [founder is committed to the success of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=260) [your company](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=263) [and that means doing whatever it

## How To Build 

 [**Reference**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=278) 

 [on how to build the first stage is the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=279) [ideating stage where you just have an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=283) [idea of what you want to build and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=286) [goal here is to build a prototype as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=288) [soon as possible with the singular Focus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=292) [to build something to show and demo to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=295) [users and it doesn't even have to work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=298) [fully in parallel your CEO co-founder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=301) [will be finding a list of users in these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=305) [next couple days to TF meetings to show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=308) [the Prototype when it's ready so the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=310) [principle here is to build very quickly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=312) [in a matter of days and sometimes I hear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=314) [it's like oh Diana a day prototype that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=317) [seems impossible how do you do it and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=320) [one way of doing it is building on top](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=323) [of a lot of prototyping software and you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=325) [keep it super super simple so for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=328) [example if you're a software company you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=330) [will build a clickable prototype perhap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=333) [using something like figma or Envision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=335) [if you're a devtools company you may](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=338) [just have a script that you wrote in an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=340) [afternoon and just launch it on the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=342) [terminal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=344) [if you're a hardware company or heart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=345) [attack it is possible to build a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=347) [prototype maybe it takes you a little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=349) [bit longer but the key here is 3D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=350) [renderings to really show you the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=352) [promise of what the product is and the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=354) [example I have here is a company called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=356) [Remora that is helping trucks capture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=358) [carbon with this attachment and that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=362) [example of that rendering was enough to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=365) [get the users excited about their](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=368) [product even though it's hard tech so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=371) [give you a couple examples of prototypes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=373) [in the early days this company](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=375) [optimizely went through YC on winter 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=376) [and they put this prototype literally in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=379) [a couple of days and the reason why is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=382) [that they had applied with YC with a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=384) [very different idea they started with a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=386) [Twitter referral widget and that idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=388) [didn't work and they quickly found out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=390) [why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=392) [so they strapped together very quickly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=393) [this prototype and it was because the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=395) [founders uh Pete and Dan and Dan was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=397) [actually heading analytics for the Obama](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=400) [campaign and he recalled that he was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=402) [called to optimize one of the funding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=404) [pages and thought huh this could be a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=407) [startup so they put a very together very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=409) [quickly together and it was the first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=411) [visual editor by creating a a b test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=413) [that was just a Javascript file that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=415) [lived on S3 I literally just opened](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=418) [option command J if you're in Chrome and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=420) [they literally run manually the A B test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=423) [there and it would work of course nobody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=425) [could use it except the founders but it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=427) [was enough to show it to marketers who](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=429) [were the target users to optimize sites](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=431) [to get the user excited so this was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=433) [built in just few days other example is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=436) [my startup Azure reality since we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=440) [building more harder Tech we had to get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=442) [computer vision algorithms running on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=445) [phones and we got that done in a few](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=447) [weeks that was a lot easier to show a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=449) [demo of what AR is as you saw on the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=452) [video than just explaining and hand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=454) [waving and made selling and explaining](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=457) [so much easier now what are some common](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=459) [mistakes on prototypes you don't want to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=462) [overbuild at this stage I've seen people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=465) [have this bias and they tell me hey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=468) [Diana but users don't see it or it's not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=470) [good enough this prototype doesn't show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=474) [the whole Vision this is the mistake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=475) [when founder things you need a full MVP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=477) [and the stage and not really the other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=479) [mistake is obviously not talking or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=482) [listening to users soon enough that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=485) [you're gonna get uncomfortable and show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=487) [this kind of prototyping duct type thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=488) [that you just slap together and that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=491) [okay you're gonna get feedback the other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=494) [one at the stage as an example for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=496) [optimizely when founders get too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=498) [attached to idea I went up the feedback](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=501) [from users is something obvious that is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=503)

 [ideas okay so now into the next section](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=510) [so imagine you have this prototype you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=513) [talk to

it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=524) [should be done also very quickly ideally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=527) [in a matter of can be done a few

Your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1515) [products you have to keep talking to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1518) [them and the other mistake I see is like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1519) [oh we're just building features for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1521) [their product](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1522) [but you also need to build Tech to grow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1523) [in fact some of the best growth hacks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1527) [where Engineers pair it up with sales](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1530) 


## How the role evolved from ideating to hiring 

 [**Reference**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1536) 

 [and growth folks who are non-technical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1534) [so now the last section on how the role](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1535) [evolves so assuming you got product](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1538) [Market fit what happens this is this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1540) [point where you can actually then put on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1543) [your big engineering pants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1546) [and figure out pieces of the tech that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1548) [need to be built to scale you need to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1552) [and the attack will break which is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1555) [actually a good thing breaking because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1557) [of too much demand and that's totally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1558) [okay that's my example from Pokemon go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1560) [you'll find the pieces that need to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1563) [reworked refactor this is when you do it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1565) [not before now not before product Market](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1567) [fit and you'll decide also what the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1569) [engineering culture will look like and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1572) [this is a stage where you actually do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1574) [more of the hiring and here you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1575) [probably going to evolve from leading a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1577) [small team of Engineers to hiring your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1580) [first hires who are going to be people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1582) [that you know and at this point Your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1583) [Role really changes because you'll start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1585) [having communication overhead and this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1587) [is when you realize your role morphs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1590) [like between two to five you still get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1592) [time to code about 70 when you get to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1594) [five to ten you only have less than 50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1596) [percent and Beyond 10 you probably won't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1598) [really have time to code and have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1601) [decide how to structure things and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1603) [whether you're going to remain as a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1605) [architect type or role or you want to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1607) [more of a people role and be more of a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1609) [BP rich now to summarize uh hear the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1610) [talk first stage ideating Bill the goal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1613) [is to build a prototype as soon as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1617) [possible and the principle is built very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1619) [quickly in a matter of days stage two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1622) [you're in the process of building an MVP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1624) [which I think a lot of you are in this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1627) [or the previous one the goal is to build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1629) [as quickly to launch in a matter of few](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1631) [weeks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1634) [and the principles are do things that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1635) [don't scale create a 90 10 solution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1636) [choose the tech for iteration speed and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1638) [the last one is once you launch all of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1642) [the previous ideas on 9010 solution do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1645) [things that don't scale still apply and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1648) [add these onto it and the goal is to get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1650) [an iteration towards product Market fit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1653) [so you're going to also quickly iterate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1655) [with hard and soft data with analytics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1657) [and user interviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1659) [you're going to continuously launch and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1661) [you're going to find the fine balance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1664) [between building and fixing and where](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1666) [techdat is totally fine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1669) [feel the heat for that Tech that is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1671) [totally fine and if there's only one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP7bpYsfa6Q&t=1673) [take away from this whole talk is
