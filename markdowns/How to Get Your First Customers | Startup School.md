to make a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=534) [list of customers you plan to reach out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=537) [to in sales it's called prospecting or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=539) [lead generation we'll just call it make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=541) [it the list and you can use Google](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=543) [spreadsheets or something like that to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=544) [make this list then we want to send

the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=550) [appropriate way to contact these people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=552) [after that you want to schedule and run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=553) [a demo or a meeting from that response](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=555) [to the email and then you want to talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=558) [pricing and then finally close them as a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=559) [customer the last thing which you should](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=561) [not forget is after you've closed them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=562) [you still need to onboard them to make](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=564) [sure that they start using your product](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=566) [if this is successful and you have good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=568) [retention that could lead to long-term](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=570) [Revenue if you forget the last step then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=571) [you will have lots of churn because](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=574) [people don't actually know how to use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=575) [your product and this is common with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=576) [early products because they are not easy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=578) [to onboard in the beginning this is not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=580) [something you spend a lot of time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=582) [optimizing so make sure that you do the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=583) [onboarding as part of this process if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=585) [you go back to the Google spreadsheets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=587) [that I'm that I'm making that I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=589) [putting in all the information you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=591) [should start simple but you should

it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=606) [pretty good idea to kind of use a simple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=609) [CRM software](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=610) [um to kind of accomplish the same goal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=612) [but the key thing here is doing

## Working backwards from your goal 

 [**Reference**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=924) 

 [let's talk about the thing that most](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=924) [Founders get wrong I've seen as many](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=927) [times but there are a few things that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=928) [most wanted to get wrong and this is one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=929) [of them working backwards from your goal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=930) [with your sales funnel in order to work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=933) [your way backwards from a goal of say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=935) [two signed customers you have to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=938) [understand that each step in the sales](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=939) [funnel is going to have a drop-off when](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=942) [you haven't started sales yet you don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=944) [know what these draft off percentages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=946) [are maybe you haven't done a lot of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=949) [sales before you don't know what you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=950) [not good at maybe you're really good at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=952) [sending emails but really bad at closing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=954) [or vice versa you don't know that so as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=955) [you're sending these outbound emails you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=958) [need to take notes and start tracking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=961) [all of these conversions in this example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=963) [I'm sending 500 Outreach emails or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=965) [LinkedIn messages I have a 50 open rate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=968) [that means 250 people will open the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=970) [email five percent will respond that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=973) [about 20 potential customers 50 of those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=975) [will convert to demo from the response](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=978) [which means I'm doing 10 demos that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=980) [pretty good but I'm not that good at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=982) [doing demos only two end up becoming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=984) [customers from the demos that's 20 I bet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=986) [you most of you don't even track this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=989) [data but you should if you track this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=991) [data you will have some idea of how long](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=993) [it will take to get to 10 paying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=995) [customers if you don't track this it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=997) [very hard for someone to give you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=999) [feedback of what's working and not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=1000) [working right it's just like when you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=1001) [launching a new product you want to have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=1003) [some metrics and some user data to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=1005) [able to tell if it's working when you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=1007) [doing sales you want to have this data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=1009) [if you have this data people will be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=1010) [able to give you feedback on what what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=1012) [you're good at and what you need to get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=1013) [get better at my advice is to use a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=1014) [simple sales CRM software that tracks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=1017) [these conversion rates automatically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=1019) [let's look at the same second example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=1020) [this is how it looks like for most](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=1022) [startups even the ones that I work with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=1024) [in the batch in the second example I'm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=1026) [sending 100 Outreach email it feels like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=1027) [a lot to me if I keep the conversion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=1029) [rates constant from the previous example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=1031) [I actually end up with zero customers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=1033) [and the conclusion the founders draw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=1035) [after this is that sales is not working](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=1036) [for me and I should just do marketing or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=1039) [SEO or something else or referrals or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=1041) [something that sounds attractive this is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=1043) [simply wrong you don't have the data to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=1044) [make that call you did not do enough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=1046) [Outreach to actually get to correct](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=1048) [conversion rate percentages in your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=1050) [sales funnel so the answer here is you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=1052) [sent a few minutes too few emails you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=1054) [don't have the data you can't draw the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=1056) [conclusion that sales is not working](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=1058) [even though you have serial customers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=1059) [and this is the mistake that funders do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=1061) [on and on and on again so to summarize](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=1063) [what I just went through here you don't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=1065) [know your sales conversion rate that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI&t=1067) [why you need a CRM to keep track of
