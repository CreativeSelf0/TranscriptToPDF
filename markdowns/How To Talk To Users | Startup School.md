there's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=675) [one big danger during interviews and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=676) [that is to focus on features instead of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=678) [problems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=679) [it's very natural for you to do that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=680) [your bra your brain is thinking through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=682) [all the ways you're going to solve

during](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=687) [this interview is to deeply understand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=688) [the problems not actually come up with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=690) [Solutions that's for for us for a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=692) [separate event so users generally

specific](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=700) [examples so early days of Gmail users](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=702) [were asking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=705) [um Paul Buchheit the founder of Gmail to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=706) [view both the Inbox and the actual

that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=713) [well the reason was simply that Gmail is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=715) [too slow and people did not want to wait](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=717) [to load each of the emails in the inbox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=719) [they want to see everything at the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=721) [time similarly in early Airbnb a lot of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=722) [guests want to have the phone numbers of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=725) [the host so they can call them we're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=727) [like why do you need that it just turned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=729) [out that they didn't fully trust the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=732) [platform like we had not displayed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=733) [enough trust in Airbnb so they needed to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=735) [feel comfortable uh with getting to

any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=745) [additional features if you ask for this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=748) [feature or this feature this feature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=749) [they'll probably say yes to everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=750) [right you however are in charge of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=752) [projectations and you have a lot more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=754) [incentives than they have to figure

## MVP prototype session interviews 

 [**Reference**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=877) 

 [start by showing it to users even if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=879) [it's just a design prototype in Envision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=881) [or something like that you can just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=883) [click through we used to do this at MB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=884) [all the time we would go downstairs in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=886) [our in our office and we would find some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=888) [people that were waiting for an](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=890) [interview or waiting for getting a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=892) [coffee or something and we just show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=894) [them the latest version of the app this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=895) [would be a Envision prototype on

is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=901) [stuff that we haven't even built yet the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=903) [key thing but if you're doing this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=905) [tactic is to not tell them what to do do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=906) [not tell them what to do just watch them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=911) [play around with it you can tell them a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=912) [specific goal like try to make a book in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=914) [Airbnb or try to do a search with dates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=916) [and even b or something like that but do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=919) [not tell them exactly how to solve each](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=921) [screen remember if this was a

them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=926) [advice another good trick when you're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=927) [doing this either when you're listening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=929) [or having them or recording them is to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=931) [have them speak their mind while they're](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=934) [doing it have them describe exactly what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=935) [they're thinking on each of the steps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=937) [maybe the words that they're reading](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=939) [maybe that will give you hints of what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=941) [words that they understand and which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=942) [words they don't understand or maybe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=944) [what specific screen means or what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=945) [purpose is and after you've done a bunch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=947) [of these interviews and then maybe MVP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=949) [protest sessions it's a great idea to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=952) [keep these interviewees involved](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=954) [throughout the process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=956) [one common idea that a lot of wasting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=957) [companies are using is to create a slack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=959) [instance or a WhatsApp group for with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iF1c8w5Lg&t=961) [their customers now you want to
